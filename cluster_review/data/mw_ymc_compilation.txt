# Compilation of Milky Way young massive cluster properties. Clusters
# included are mostly the same as those in the compilation of
# Portegies-Zwart et al., 2010, ARA&A, 48, 431, but the data have been
# updated where possible using the references listed. We have also
# added a few new clusters discovered since 2010, and removed Trumpler
# 14 and h and chi Persei, since the most recent mass estimates
# (Sana et al., 2010, A&A, 515, A26 for Trumpler 14 and Currie et al.,
# 2010, ApJS, 186, 191) reduces their mass to well below our
# cutoff at 10^4 Msun.
#
# Columns are:
# 1) Name
# 2) log_10 (Mass / Msun)
# 3) Error on log mass, if available
# 4) Half-mass radius [pc]
# 5) Error on half-mass radius, if available

# Notes on individual entries
#
# 1) C12 estimate the mass and radius of the Arches several ways. Our
#    reported measurements are taken from their table 12, which fits
#    the cluster to a King (1962) model using a combination of kinematic
#    data and surface density data. To derive the half-mass radius and
#    its uncertainty, we compute the use the 1 sigma-low and 1 sigma-high
#    values of their reported core and tidal radii to compute the
#    corresponding half-mass radius for a King model, and take that to
#    be our 1 sigma uncertainty interval on r_h. Our central value of
#    r_h is the center of that +- 1 sigma interval.
# 2) Portegies-Zwart et al. cite Figer et al. (2006, ApJ, 643, 1166)
#    on this source, but this paper appears merely to quote the earlier,
#    1999 paper that we have listed.
# 3) Mass is from B12, radius from B08; the authors do not quote
#    uncertainties
# 4) The estimates listed are from photometry in HEM08, but are
#    consistent with a kinematic upper limit derived by R10
# 5) Mass estimate is from the stated source; the radius estimate is
#    from Portegies-Zwart et al. (2010), who appear to have measured an
#    effective radius directly from the published images. No radius
#    estimate is listed in F06.
# 6) Half-light radius used for r_h because half-mass radius is unknown.
# 7) Mass is as stated in the source listed; radius is our rough
#    estimate based on the published images, and should not be treated
#    as accurate to better than the factor of ~2 level.
# 8) Z17 fit the density distribution in Westerlund 2, which is not
#    relaxed, with two Gaussians separated in space. The characteristic
#    radius we list here is the separation between the two components.
